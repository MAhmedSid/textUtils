</strong>APP IS CREATED WITH REACT-JS</strong>

this app is not deployed anywhere, anymore.


You can test it easily by using some following steps:

1. In the <code>src</code> folder, open <strong>App.js</strong> in the IDE.
2. Then run command in terminal <code>npm i</code>.
3. After the creation of <strong>node_modules</strong> folder. Run command <code>npm start</code> 
4. Then open the local-host:3000 on your browser to view the app.


Thankyou. I hope about viewer suggestions. So don't forget to suggest about my app. 

True Developer,
